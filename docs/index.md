## 🚀 What is TransactionProcessing?

The TransactionProcessing library provides a robust framework for handling financial transactions within BNC’s internal systems. It offers:

- **Consistent transaction lifecycle management**
- **Built-in retry logic** for transient failures
- **Comprehensive logging and audit trails**
- **Extensible hooks** for custom business logic

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Install the library** (internal package registry):

   ```bash
   npm install @bnc/transaction-processing
   ```

2. **Basic Usage Example:**

   ```typescript
   import { TransactionProcessor } from '@bnc/transaction-processing';

   const processor = new TransactionProcessor();

   processor.process({
     type: 'WIRE_TRANSFER',
     amount: 1000,
     currency: 'CAD',
     onSuccess: (result) => console.log('Success:', result),
     onError: (err) => console.error('Error:', err),
   });
   ```

3. **Retry Logic:**  
   By default, the processor retries failed transactions up to 3 times with exponential backoff.

## 🧑‍💻 When to Use This Library

- When you need **consistent transaction handling** across microservices
- When you want to **reduce duplicated logic** for retries, logging, and error handling
- When you require **auditability** for compliance
